### Results

- It did not affect the district summary after the changes. The images below shows first the original then the revised table.

- Changes barely affected Thomas High School and did not affect the other schools since the changes applied to Thomas High School. 

- Replacing the ninth-graders' math and reading scores with N/A's barely changed Thomas High School performance compared to the other 14 schools. 
  - THS is still 2nd place among the highest performing high schools.     
  - 
  - Math and Reading scores are not affected with the other grades except for the ninth grade in THS.  
  - 
  - Since THS is in the $631-645 range, it only changed that row of values (Average % Passing Reading and % Overall).  The change is not drastic.
  -  
  - THS is in the medium range, it only changed the values slightly in % Passing Reading
  - 
  - THS is a charter school, but the averages in School Types did not change at all.
